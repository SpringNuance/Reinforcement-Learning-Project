    "# 3. Sanding Task <a id='3.'></a>\n",
    "The primary objective in this project is to optimize a sanding robot's behavior, aiming to maximize the expected cumulative reward $ J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{\\theta}}\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r_t \\right] $. The simulator for the sanding task is provided in the \"sanding.py\" Python file. This section defines the sanding task. Please, see below.\n",

    "- **Robot Characteristics**: The robot is visualized as a <span style=\"color:purple\">purple</span> circle with a radius of 10, operating on a 2D plane. The x and y coordinates range from -50 to 50.\n",
    "- **Sanding & No-Sanding Areas**: There are sanding (<span style=\"color:green\">green</span>) and no-sanding (<span style=\"color:red\">red</span>) areas, each with a radius of 10. Their configurations vary based on the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "$a_x, a_y$ selects the current target coordinates of the robot arm. A PD-controller~\\cite{X} trys to move the robot arm from the current coordinates $(x_{\\text{ROBOT}}, y_{\\text{ROBOT}})$ to the target coordinates $a_x, a_y$. You do not need to necessarily understand how exactly the PD-controller works but the controller may not always move the robot to the correct coordinates in one time step, and, it may also overshoot the target location. Please, see below for a visualization of this behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "The robot can only sand a sanding or no-sanding location once. All sanding and no-sanding locations that are touched by the robot will be moved outside the operating area, that is, those locations will be outside the operating area in the subsequent time step. \n",
