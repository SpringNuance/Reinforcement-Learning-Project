    "The goal of the project work is to optimize the behavior of a sanding robot using reinforcement learning such that the robot avoids already painted areas but sands areas that need sanding. We give now a general motivation and task description. [Section 3](#3-task-definition) provides a more detailed task definition.\n",

    "The robot operates on a 2-D plane and should hit a set of \"sanding areas\" using the sanding tool equipped. At the same time the robot has to avoid specific \"painted areas\" which are also defined as part of the system state. The sanding areas and painted areas are defined as part of the state space. The robot gets a negative reward for hitting painted areas and a positive reward for sanding sanding areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to optimize the behavior of the robot using reinforcement learning based on either the PPO or DDPG algorithm. You should extend PPO or DDPG such that you get higher performance in the more challenging versions of the sanding task. When answering questions and documenting source code the important thing is to clearly state which kind of methods and techniques you have used and especially **why** you have used those.\n",

    "[Section 3](#3-task-definition) defines the sanding task. [Section 4](#4-code-structure--files-a-id4a) shows the structure of the provided file directory. [Section 5](#5-requirements-possible-extensions-and-hints-a-id5a) discusses the **mandatory project requirements** and **possible extensions** to the basic PPO and DDPG algorithms. [Section 6](#6-evaluation--grading-a-id7a) describes how the project is evaluated and graded. In [Section 7](#7-source-code-a--7a), you will add your implementation, perform the tasks and answer questions. \n",
    "In [Section 8](#8-feedback-a-id8a), you can provide feedback on the project work. The feedback is important since this is the first year this project work is used on the course.\n",

    "Note that if you have a plan for the project work but are unsure whether the plan satisfies the project work requirements, ask the teaching assistants for advice on Zulip."
