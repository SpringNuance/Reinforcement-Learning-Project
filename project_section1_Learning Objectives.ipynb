Create a new file called either 'ddpg_extension.py' or 'ppo_extension.py' in folder 'algos'. Do the following: 1. The base algorithm's performance must be improved such that the agent succeeds in the moderate difficulty environment. Report the results (training plot and test performance) for all three environments; 2. Follow the provided structure such that it can be tested with function 'test(agent)'; 3. If you implemented multiple extensions analyze the difference in performance between the extensions . (40 points)</a>\n",

At the end of the course, we will use everyone's improved agent (please submit your pretrained weights) to run the competition on the most difficult sanding environment. Competitive grading: all projects are evaluated in the difficult environment for performance and put into ranking order. Top 10% of submitted projects get bonus points. Best performing project (100% ranked) gets 20 bonus points, 95% ranked gets 10 bonus points, 90% or lower ranked gets 0 bonus points. (+20 points) </a>\n",

    "In the project work, students move to a more independent working style compared with the exercises. In the exercises, instructions and template code for reinforcement learning algorithms was provided. However, in the project work the students are given **a new task** that they need to solve using reinforcement learning methods discussed during the course and others. The students need to decide which method they will use (either PPO or DDPG), extend the method, and explain why. Students may take advantage of code that they have already developed in the exercises or which was part of the exercises."
